## Purpose

This project is aimed to predict which customers are at risk of churning from their credit card services, as more and more customers leaving their credit card services. In this project, we utilize exploratory data analysis and machine learning models to identify potential chrun risks. 

We have applied three algorithms -- Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with XGBoost yielding the most accurate results to predict whether a customer is an existing customer or an attrited customer. 

With XGBoost, we are able to achieve a 95% accuracy rate and 92% recall rate on the test dataset, successfully distinguishing between existing and attrited customers.
